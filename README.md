# Bixi
BIXI Montreal (hereafter: Bixi), established in 2014 by the city of Montreal, is a non-profit organization responsible for overseeing the bike-sharing system. As of 2023, Bixi owns 10,000 bikes that can be accessed through nearly 800 stations. Our goal is to gain a high-level understanding of how people use Bixi bikes, what factors influence the volume of usage, popular stations, and overall business growth. The data used for this project is focused on April-November 2016 and
2017.

In this project, I seamlessly blended essential skills to conduct in-depth data analysis, harness interactive `Tableau visualizations`, and demonstrate proficient `SQL querying`. This dynamic trio formed the backbone of a thorough `exploratory analysis` of Bixi bike usage data. Through adept SQL utilization, I efficiently extracted, transformed, and prepared raw data for analysis, ensuring its conversion into valuable insights.

Central to the project was the creation of an impactful visualization dashboard, designed meticulously to serve as a visually captivating and interactive platform for data exploration. The dashboard's unique feature of drill-down capabilities empowered users to navigate deeper into nuances of Bixi bike usage, unearthing hidden patterns and `trends` that evade casual observation.

The culmination of my work found its expression in `professional documentation`, expertly merging the `analytical rigor` of data exploration with the communicative prowess of visualizations. These findings were translated into `actionable recommendations` through clear explanations complemented by visually engaging charts and graphs. This documentation, bridging the gap between technical insights and pragmatic decision-making, catered comprehensively to `diverse stakeholders`.
